## Consumer Age by Category

Based on the distributions below, we can see that there is ***nearly a
20 year age gap*** between the median age of the group that most often
purchases **Vapes or Extracts**, then that of **Topicals**. Furthermore,
the distributions begin highly skewed to the left around the legal age
of consumption (21 y/o) but have a tendancy to normalize around the
average age of the group as you go down.

Some hypotheses around this notable change and shift in distribution
could center around the accessibility and potential market growth of
product categories. For instance, it's worth noting that topicals seem
to be accessible to a wider age group and therefore the potential for
market growth for topicals products seems to be higher then that of
Vapes or Extracts. Note this is in reference to growth and not size.
Market size for vapes or extracts remains markedly high.
