::: callout-note
This builds from previous posts about the Surgical Learning Curve in
Robotic Assisted Surgery. For an intro on the background, data, and
various definitions, see [this
post](https://rdata.blog/posts/A%20Gentle%20Intro%20to%20Surgical%20Performance/).
Additionally, see
[here](https://rdata.blog/posts/Assessing%20Performance%20with%20Surgical%20Learning%20Curves/)
for my first post describing the work of modeling these learning curves
as well as important applications of these models in quantifying
surgical efficiency and surgeon proficiency.

## Influencing the Curve

> Surgeons who perform procedures more often outperform surgeons that
> complete the same number of procedures less often (more days between
> cases)

Analysis of the learning curve model for various cohorts of Surgeons can
help identify specific drivers of increased performance. For example,
the following exploratory visualization (figure 1) provides support to
the hypothesis that Surgeons who perform procedures more often
outperform surgeons that complete the same number of procedures less
often (more days between cases). The performance indicator in this case
is overall procedure duration. In figure 1 below, the frequency
difference between groups is identified empirically using the top and
bottom 25th percentile in the total number of days between cases.[^1]
This observation is seen across all 6 procedure types indicated in the
plot below.

Groups](images/Comparison%20of%20Frequency%20Groups.jpg)

Figure 1 above shows the difference in Average Procedure Duration across
groups of surgeons that were classified as performing 100 total
procedures more frequently (the top 70th percentile in time taken to
perform 100 total cases) vs less frequently (bottom 30th percentile). By
controlling for total cases performed across groups, we can capture the
true impact that frequency has on the learning curve outcome measure
used (procedure duration).

[^1]: Surgeon in the ‘less often’ group have an average count of days
    between cases that falls in the top 25th percentile (more days).

## Actionable Learning Indicators (Levers of Learning)

The following variables have been studied and demonstrated to have a
significant impact on the learning curve. These are referred to as
Levers of Learning. 

-   **Case Mix**: captures effects attributed to general complexity,
    degree of specialization, and transferred background learning. Case
    Mix best accounts for procedure agnostic learning that can be
    transferred across a series of different cases that a given surgeon
    performs
-   **Case Frequency**:captures the effect on expected efficiency that
    is largely attributed to the time between subsequent cases.
    Empirical observations of robotic surgery data suggest that a large
    portion of the gain in efficiency that comes from Surgeon learning
    is the degree of exposure a surgeon has within a fixed period of
    time
-   **Procedure Velocity**: is a derivation of Case Frequency; however,
    the interpretation of Velocity is not based on exposure within a
    fixed period of time. Rather, Velocity is expressed as a
    point-in-time measure of the degree of case exposure, for all
    historical cases through most recent observation.[^2]

[^2]: More simply, Velocity is calculated as the cumulative average
    procedures per-day for a surgeon and expressed at a specific case N,
    while Frequency is a simple average associated with a period (e.g.
    between cases 10 and 20).

### Benchmarking with Baseline Learning Curve

The following illustrates a baseline learning curve modeled using
Robotic Surgery data across a number of procedure types. Furthermore, we
can adjust model parameters to understand its impact on the learning
trajectory. The top most learning curve in figure 2 is the baseline
expected trajectory of procedure duration through a surgeons first 100
cases. From there, we show new learning curves assuming greater and
greater case frequency scenarios. The result demonstrates that if
surgeons perform cases more frequently as they continue gaining
experience, then they actually shift to a more desirable learning curve.
