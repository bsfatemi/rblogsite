# Summary

Robotic Surgical learning curves can be modeled using data generated
during each procedure by grouping Surgeon's into cohorts by Surgical
Specialty, and comparing the groups average procedure duration across
cases. These models have many potential applications and can be highly
useful in providing benchmarks used to assess surgical efficiency and
proficiency. Furthermore, these models can be utilized to drive internal
business decisions focused around surgeon training programs and
products. Finally, learning curves can provide a basis to quantify the
impact that existing training can have on surgical expertise and
learning.

# Introduction

Learning curves are models that describe the expected change in a
variable (referred to as the ‘outcome measure’), by another variable
that is selected as a proxy for experience. Figure 1 represents the
Average Procedure Duration (outcome measure), for a group of surgeons,
by their respective case number (proxy for experience).

Curve](images/Chole%20Learning%20Curve.jpg)

In this example, the surgeons in each cohort perform the same procedure
subject (Cholecystectomy) and are grouped into a cohort based on their
case number.

-   The size of the cohort decreases over time, as represented by the
    size of the points in the chart, because fewer surgeons perform a
    high number of cases.
-   The y-axis represents average procedure duration for the group of
    surgeons, while the x-axis shows the case volume that the group has
    reached.

### Support for Utilizing Learning Curves

Based on widespread review of available academic literature conducted in
this effort, as well as extensive internal analysis, there is strong
support and consensus for utilizing learning curves to achieve
objectives in the following high-level categories:

1.  Driving internal business decisions focused around surgeon training
    programs and products; learning curves can provide a basis to
    quantify the impact that existing training can have on surgical
    expertise and learning.
2.  Providing learning curve knowledge back to our surgeons and
    hospitals in the form of structured and validated insights to
    empower their own individual decision-making associated with their
    personal learning, knowledge gathering, proficiency, and overall
    execution of a surgical procedure.

# Potential Applications

Due to the variability at the individual surgeon level, learning models
by cohort provides us a more robust benchmark that can be used for
individual performance monitoring (e.g. an individual surgeon can know
their performance relative to similar surgeons) and enables comparison
across groups (e.g. experienced surgeons vs. less experienced surgeons
who perform the same procedure). The following figure demonstrates an
example case where the learning curve in Figure 1 was transformed to
represent expected efficiency, and then a selected surgeon’s data was
benchmarked against the cohort. This is seen in Figure 2 below.

These important comparisons can lead to insights that answer questions
such as:

-   Does surgeon training impact a given outcome measure? Which programs
    have most impact (e.g. accelerates learning the fastest)?
-   Does procedure velocity (frequency of surgery) impact surgeon
    learning? If so, what is the quantified impact to procedure
    efficiency measures? What is the optimal frequency of procedures to
    perform for each type of procedure?
-   How do we help Surgeons effectively pivot from less complex
    procedures (hernia) to more complex procedures?

# Additional Findings

Preliminary models across a range of different surgical procedures
guides our understanding that the rate of learning, using procedure
duration as the outcome measure[^1], varies by subject, while other
attributes such as the hospital environment, the surgical instruments
utilized, etc. shift the curve upwards or downwards.

Types](images/Comparison%20of%20Curves.jpg)

[^1]: Rate of learning can be described as: the decrease in an outcome
    being measured, over each subsequent case, time, or other measure of
    experience

### Insights from Figure 3

-   Figure 3 illustrates the difference in the learning patterns across
    procedure subjects when controlling for other attributes (such as
    the size or type of the hospital site).
-   We can see from this preliminary assessment that Prostatectomies and
    Hysterectomies seems to reflect a similar rate of learning in
    procedure duration. However, a Hysterectomy takes longer to complete
    on average (as seen by the absolute level depicted in the chart),
    while Myomectomies have both a faster learning curve (easier in
    complexity) and takes less time to complete.

These initial models were found to be statistically significant and
serve as the best evidence that additional effort would produce high
impact value to many stakeholders.
