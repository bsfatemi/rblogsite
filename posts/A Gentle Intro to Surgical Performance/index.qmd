## Background of Research

In my prior work as a data scientist working in the medical/healthcare
space, I got the opportunity to work closely with Surgeons at major
academic institutions across the United States. My role at the time was
to partner with hospital networks or individual academic surgeons in a
joint research initiative to set up a data architecture and execute on a
long-term data collection effort focused only on surgical performance
KPIs, namely ***Surgical Efficiency and Proficiency** metrics*[^1].

Most importantly, these efforts were conducted at scale and would result
in the aggregation of a massive amount of longitudinal metrics
describing ***Surgical Actions***.

Surgical Actions

:   Time-stamped records of actions performed by the surgeon over the
    course of a surgical procedure

Surgical Efficiency

:   Metrics describing the operating efficiency of an OR Team and
    Surgeon working together to complete a surgical procedure

Surgical Proficiency

:   Benchmarks describing the relative expertise level of a surgeon
    performing a procedure

[^1]: In this work, we were primarily interested in data about the
    Surgeons, and observational metrics describing their performance
    during the procedure, rather than healthcare outcomes. Thus, no
    personally identifiable information was collected. This simplified
    our work ensuring all HIPAA rules and regulations were satisfied.

### About the Data Collected

The dataset ultimately collected covered thousands of surgeons across
the United States over a period of 5 years. The population of Surgeons
in the data included a wide range of experience levels ranging from
novice, having performed fewer than 10 procedures, to expert surgeons
that have completed more than 300 procedures. Additionally, the
population of surgeons include a many different surgical specialties,
performing a wide range of cases including gynecological, thoracic,
cardiac, and more.

## Producing Surgical Performance KPIs

The the raw point-in-time Surgical Actions data collected would
ultimately be transformed, and the resulting data is best described as
event-based and resembled the following:

## Step II - Events Processed From Raw Surgical Actions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

8:45:01AM - OR Team Pre-Op Setup Begins

8:55:16AM - OR Team Pre-Op Setup Completes

8:57:05AM - Surgeon Begins Procedure

8:57:05AM - Surgeon Uses Instrument X (3 minutes and 5 seconds)

9:00:10AM - Surgeon Switches Instrument X with Y

9:00:55AM - Surgeon Idle For 45 seconds

9:03:05AM - Surgeon Uses Instrument Y (2 minutes and 45 seconds)

9:05:50AM - Surgeon Completes Procedure

9:05:50AM - OR Team Post-Op Process Begins

9:15:10AM - OR Team Post-Op Process Completes

The events above would then be summarized into procedure-level metrics
that describe surgical proficiency, efficiency, or both

## Step III - Metrics Summarized From Events Data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-danger appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
###### Efficiency Metrics

Total OR Procedure Duration.................. 30 minutes and 9 seconds

Total Surgeon Operating Time................ 5 minutes and 50 seconds

Total Surgeon Idle Duration.................... 45 seconds

Total Non-Surgery Duration.................... 20 minutes 35 seconds
:::

::: {.callout-danger appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
###### Proficiency Metrics

Unique Surgical Instruments Used......... 2

Total Surgical Instrument Swaps............. 1

Lastly, these metrics would then be translated to KPIs, benchmarked
against a target performance level[^2], and presented to the Executive
Stakeholders of this work.

## Step IV - Translate Procedure Metrics to Performance KPIs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-danger appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
###### Surgeon Efficiency Rate - 88%

*Falls within the Highly Efficient Range*
:::

::: {.callout-danger appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
###### OR Team Efficiency Rate - 65%

*Falls within the Average Efficiency Range*
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[^2]: The Target Performance for benchmarking would be derived by
    identifying a control group of Surgeons with high experience levels
    and are known to be both efficient and proficient. The metric values
    for these expert surgeons would guide the assessment of performance
    for all other Surgeons.

## What's Next

Once there was enough of these historical surgical actions data
collected, that's when the interesting part of my work would begin...
the analysis!

Subscribe to my blog and stay tuned for upcoming posts where I dive into
this work and share some fascinating insights effort to develop Surgical
Learning Curve models, and further present a case study where I
demonstrate how to use these models as the foundation for assessing the
surgical expertise and monitoring novice surgeons as they progress along
their own learning curves.
