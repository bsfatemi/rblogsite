# Prices Across All Orgs

As a whole, the average unit price across most categories have been on
the decline since the start of 2022. The three largest categories in the
market are (1) Flowers, (2) Vapes, and (3) Edibles. The plot below shows
the average unit price of these product categories. We can observe the
decline is most significant with vapes, followed closely by flower, then
less dramatically with edibles.

## Analyzing Vape Product Prices

As an example of the analysis we do internally, I've decided to focus on
Vapes to highlight our findings.

Looking deeper at the price of vapes, I analyzed and found that 57 total
orgs had a statistically significant upward or downward trajectory. Of
those 57, the majority had declining prices (49). For those 49
organizations, the following chart shows the average monthly price since
January 2022.

## A Look at Other Categories

The chart below highlights all product category prices over time. As can
be seen, only two categories have no declining trajectory in average
product price.
