Here are some basic facts about Discount Elasticity:

-   Discount elasticity is used to measure the relationship between a
    targetted decrease in price and demand and such discounts to price
    will affect the demand.

-   For elastic products, you can increase the discounts up to a certain
    point in order to expect an increase in demand.

-   For inelastic products, if you increase discounts past a certain
    point, you don't expect increasing demand and therefore you
    experience overall losses in profit.

Most products in cannabis are elastic to a certain level of discounting,
but inelastic after that point. This discount level should be the
maximum level of discounting offered by retailers.

This work demonstrates the ability to determine by Brand and Category,
whether products are price elastic (i.e. discounts drive velocity
significantly) or whether discounts have limited impact on sales
velocity[^1] (i.e. discounts decrease profits without significant impact
on velocity).

# Modeling the Relationship

First, let's take a look at a higher level model that describes observed
discounts across all Cannabis Flower products and changes in weekly
sales velocity[^2].

    and ending 2023.

# Extracting a Usable Model

Next let's break this model down to the most useable form: a model for a
particular brand and category. Using Camino edibles, a very popular
product segment, the following model is fitted to the data:

The following insights can be extracted from Camino's discount demand
model:

1.  The point of discount elasticity for Camino is slightly under 12%
    discount level. This means that any discount above 12% is not
    driving higher demand and only eating profits (on average)

2.  Additionally, if you're discounting level is below 4%, the expected
    demand level is \<25%, meaning there's a lot of demand left on the
    table

3.  For instance, going from 4% discount to 8% discount should double
    your expected sales velocity with the proper marketing; however to
    acheive the same doubling of sales velocity at 9% requires going up
    to 11% only

4.  The higher your discounting already is, the more marginal your
    expected increase in demand will be with additional increases in
    discount

# Expanding this Work

As you can see from the next chart, we can derive these models at scale
for a large number of popular brands and product categories. Each brand
has it's unique model that describes differing demand and discount
relationships, however, all suggest that these models can be used to
estimate the maximum discount level and expected demand gains from
changes in discounts up until that point:
