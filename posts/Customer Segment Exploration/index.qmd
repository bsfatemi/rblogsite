# Customer Segment Definitions

The set of new segments centers around customer preferences for
particular product categories, as well as purchase habits and buying
behavior. First, let's discuss product preference segments

## Category Exclusive Consumers

I've identified 9 product categories that are used to classify
customerrs based on their preference for each category. All customers
classified here are regular customers. First, let's review the 9 product
categories:

Vapes

:   Cartridges, Pods, Disposables

Extracts

:   Dab, Wax, Shatter, Budder, Live Resin, Syringe products, etc.

Tinctures

:   Tinctures products

Topicals

:   Ointment, lotion, balm, salve, bath bombs, bath salts, etc.

**Tablets**

:   Tablets, capsules, pills, excludes lozanges and mints

Drinks

:   Beverage products only, includes syrups and drink mixers

Edibles

:   Candy, gummies, sweets, baked goods, lozanges, mints, etc.

Flower

:   Prepackaged, small batches, various quantities, etc.

Prerolls

:   Pre-rolled joints, blunts, infused & non-infused

For every category above, there's a segment of customers that mostly
prefers that category. These customers are called **category exclusive
consumers.** A category exclusive customer is someone who has spent at
least 75% of their total dollars towards products of a particular
category over the course of many regular orders over a period of time.

## Discount Sensitive Consumers

Discount senstive consumers are repeat customers whose average discount
rate is above the majority of the rest of the customers, and
furthermore, their discount rate impacts their tendancy towards a higher
sales velocity (they come back more often as discount rates increase,
and less frequently as they decline). Its important to note that
contrary to intuition, not all customers respond to discount rates just
like not all products are discount elastic (lower price doesn't always
drive more demand).

## Most and Least Frequent Buyers

Frequency has been identified as a major trait describing customer
behavior. The flags **Most Frequent** and **Least Frequent** refer to
repeat customers whose *days between orders* falls in the smallest group
(less days between these customer's orders) and largest group (more days
between their orders). Frequency often impacts factors such as (1) how
large or small the order size will be (2) how often will the consumer
purchase a product they've previously never purchased.

## High vs Low Dollar Spenders

These two segments are pretty straightforward. High dollar spenders are
customers that have a historical order size that falls in the highest
quartile group; while low dollar spenders have an average historical
order size falling in the lowest quartile group. In the case of Verano,
we can see from the table below that high spenders have an average order
total of \$195 (vs \$44 for Low spenders).

# Customer Segment Statistics

The following plot highlights the segments defined above, as well as how
many Verano customers fall in each group:

The following table demonstrates the differences between these segments
in various summary statistics.

## Segment Comparisons and Other Insights

Here are some takeaway insights from the summary statistics table above:

-   The segment with the lowest average age (35) is customers that
    prefer extracts. The groups with the highest average age is Topicals
    (59), Tinctures (58), and Tablets (53).

-   Customers that prefer prerolls have a comparitively low average
    order total (\$52), which is only slightly greater than the group of
    customers that are classified as Low Spenders (\$44)

-   Besides the *High Spender* group, the segments with the highest
    average order total are those that prefer Extracts (\$104) and those
    that prefer Vapes (\$103)

-   Customers that order most frequently have a lower average order
    total (\$89) vs customers that order least frequently (\$111)

-   High spenders tend to be older than low spenders (44 vs 38)
