## Background

This post is focused on the impact of supply chain volatility on
retailer inventory overhead costs, specifically, I aim to define the
supply chain problem facing cannabis retailers, and discuss strategies
to reduce inventory overhead costs while ensuring sufficient product
coverage[^1] to meet growing demand.

[^1]: Product coverage describes how well a retailer's menu meets the
    demand of their customer base. Gaps in product coverage tend to lead
    to missed sales revenue and customer attrition

## Exploring The Data

The data I utilized for this analysis are daily inventory snapshots
beginning on 4/12/22 and ending on 9/24/23. The data for this time
period includes roughly 385K unique products across 118 retail
locations.

Here are a few key insights on the retailers I studied:

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
**On average, Retailers...**

-   Carry 730 products in inventory on any given day, and 2,300 unique
    products over the course of a year
-   Have 500K units across all products in inventory on a given day
-   The average cost of inventory held by the retailer on a given day is
    roughly \$120K, equating to an average of roughly \$500 in costs per
    product in stock
-   Carry products that are available to sell for 72 days of the year,
    while being out of stock for roughly 20% of the time between its'
    first sale and last sale (see figure below)

In short, **products that have reoccurring supply (resupplied more than
once) during this period, tend to go out of stock every 5 days (e.g. 20%
of the days within its' sales period), causing a sales disruption**.
This can be seen in the figure above which shows the average sales
period for products by org, and identifies the proportion of days in and
out of stock during the sales period.

## Supply Chain Volatility

In cannabis, we see evidence that consumer demand is much more
predictable than supply. In fact, in response to this supply chain
volatility, retailers are often overstocking products due to the
uncertainty around future availability from suppliers. This results in
growing inventory costs over time, as the natural tendency in a highly
competitive industry is to ensure products are always available to meet
demand. In an environment where products are highly interchangeable,
such as in the cannabis space, inventory can and should be optimized to
address supply chain issues.

### What does "optimized inventory" look like...

Optimized inventory ensures that a retailer can meet changing demand
without incurring additional and unnecessary inventory costs. In
practical terms, over a long period of time (in the case of this
analysis 75 weeks), it is reasonable to expect that inventory costs
should be correlated with sales trends over the same period.
:::

For this group of retailers studied here that show increasing inventory
levels, we can see in the figure below that their trend in inventory is
not correlated with growth in sales.

## Results of Analysis

Of the 118 retailers whose inventory I studied over the course of 75
weeks, 82% of these stores experience highly volatile and/or growing
inventory at a rate that far exceeds any growth in sales. **This is very
consistent with the notion that supply chain volatility leads to highly
volatile retail inventory levels** (both as measured by the costs to
carry stock, as well as the total units on hand for any given week) and
is additional evidence that overstocking is an issue affecting retailers
industry-wide.

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
Nearly half of the retailers that comprise the 82% are experiencing
highly accelerated growth in both total units on hand in a given week as
well as total inventory costs carried per week. While the remaining
experience unsustainable swings in total units available week to week.

### Growth in Weekly Stock

The chart below shows the average weekly percent change in total
inventory units on hand (all products) for 39 retail locations.
Additionally, we can see the 85% confidence interval *`in red`* around
each week in the period, as well as the week to week group average shown
with the black line.

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
These 39 retail locations show a 250% year over year growth of total
units carried in inventory, relative to the amount of stock carried in
week one

::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple"}
Note, weekly stock is defined as the total units carried (across all
rooms for a retailer). Additionally, in the charts shown, weekly stock
level is expressed as a percentage relative to the amount of stock
carried in week one. This lets us normalize retailers of varying sizes
in order to draw a fair comparison when analyzing how inventory changes
overtime.

### Volatility in Weekly Stock

The chart below shows the average weekly % change in total inventory
units on hand (all products) for 54 retail locations. Similar to the
plot above, the blue demonstrates the 85% confidence interval around the
average per week, while the black line represents the average over time
for the group.

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
For these 54 retail locations, we see roughly no change in units on hand
between the first week and last week in the period, however during the
course of the year, inventory levels swing as low as 50% and as high as
200% relative to the amount of stock carried in week one.

### Declining Weekly Stock (Total Units Carried)

The remaining 18% of retailers are adequately reducing inventory costs
while maintaining or growing sales over the same period.
