# Metric Definitions

The following KPIs were calculated for all budtenders across 36 of 39
Verano retail locations. These are the table columns corresponding to
each metric, as well as their definitions

`total_sales`

:   *Total dollar sales in period for a given budtender*

`order_days`

:   *Number of days within the period that the budtender has completed
    orders*

`orders_per_day`

:   *The average orders sold per day for a budtender within the given
    period. This is calculated by dividing a budtenders total orders
    within the period by `order_days`*

`dollars_per_day`

:   *The average dollar sales per day for a budtender within the given
    period. This is calculated as `total_sales` / `order_days`*

`ave_order_size_no_house`

:   *The average ticket size for a budtender when their orders do NOT
    include a Verano brand house product*

`ave_order_size_house`

:   *The average ticket size for a budtender when their orders DO
    include a Verano brand house product*

**`ave_house_dollars_per_order`**

:   *The average dollar amount spent per order on Verano brand house
    products, when the budtender sells Verano in the order. This is
    strictly less than or equal to `ave_order_size_house` as it is the
    portion of `ave_order_size_house` that is actually spent on Verano
    items*

**`house_order_premium`**

:   *This describes how much greater a budtender's average ticket size
    is when selling an order that contains a house product (vs orders
    that do not). This is calculated as (`ave_order_size_house` -
    `ave_order_size_no_house`) / `ave_order_size_no_house`*

`pct_orders_house`

:   *The percentage of a budtenders total orders within a given period
    that contain at least one Verano house product*

`pct_dollars_house`

:   *The percentage of a budtenders `total_sales` in the period that
    came from selling Verano house products*
