The following can be extracted as takeaways based on the analysis
conducted for this post:

-   Kind Peoples (e.g. Highway Cannabis) is a retailer that has invested
    heavily in Zoltrain's rewards program, which is reflected in its
    results

-   The results suggest that a rewards program being taken advantage of
    by budtenders consistently over a period of multiple months produce
    the maximum impact at the retail location

-   CLSICS and PAX lead the field of brands in terms of offering the
    most rewards and the sales lift impact driven by budtenders
    redeeming such rewards

-   Rewards have less impact when they are offered sporadically over the
    course of 6 months to a year. For example:

    -   At Kind Peoples, PAX rewards were redeemed in 11 of the 16
        months (at Oceanstreet) and 10 of the 17 months (at Soquel)
        during the rewards period, and this has maximized the impact to
        Sales (+221% and +145% respectively). See appendix for the plot
        describing this.

    -   Additionally, CLSICS at Kind Peoples (Soquel) where the rewards
        period was 4 weeks and 3 of the weeks had rewards redeemed by
        budtenders at very positive impact. In compared with the prior 4
        weeks in which no rewards were redeemed, CLSICS experienced a
        +279% bump. See appendix for the plot describing this.
