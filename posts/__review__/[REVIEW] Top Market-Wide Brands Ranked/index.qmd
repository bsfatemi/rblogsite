# About Our Sales Data... {style="color: green"}

-   As of this post, there are 130 distinct retail organizations with
    342 store locations across 30+ sales markets in the US that generate
    all the transactions in our database.
-   These retailers have sold over 192.6M product units totaling \$5B in
    sales revenue since 2018.
-   Furthermore there are over 90K uniquely identifiable brands
    associated with all products sold and revenue generated since 2018.

## Objective

In this post, I identify all brands that have product sales
market-wide[^1], and among those brands, rank the top 25 by two key
metrics defined below: Total Daily Market-Sales, and Recently Trending
Sales Growth

Total Daily Market-Sales

:   A brand's total sales across all retailers, on a daily basis This
    analysis utilizes these daily total sales for a 90-day period ending
    on 9/29/23

Recently Trending Sales Growth

:   This is calculated as the percent change in **Average** **Total
    Daily Market-Sales** for the past 7-days over the full prior 90-day
    period and expressed as a percentage increase/decrease from the
    90-day average to the recent 7 day average

[^1]: Market-wide in this context are brands that are available across
    multiple retail organizations with minimum levels of unit and total
    dollar sales per day. For additional details, see callout titled
    'Brand Eligibility for Ranking..." under section **Methodology**

## Methodology

Using 90 days of sales transactions, I first identify brands eligible
for ranking (i.e. brands that meet the selection criteria described
below). Next, I define the two metrics used to rank selected brands: (1)
Average Daily Market-Sales and (2) Recent Trends in Sales Growth (both
defined above). Finally, I calculate these two metrics over the full
90-day sales period, as well as the most recent 7 days and use these
results to rank the top 25 brands for each of the two metrics. The next
section provides the details of the selection criteria used to determine
whether brands are considered for ranking or ruled out.

### Brand Eligibility For Ranking...

I.  This report and the rankings presented are generated using sales
    data that dates back 90 days as of 9/29/2023
II. There are in total over 20,000 uniquely identifiable brands in sales
    transactions for this 90-day period
III. Of the 20K individual brands, 1,500 met the first filtering
     criteria: have at least 1000 unit sales, and 10,000 total sales in
     the 90-day sales period
IV. The final selection criteria is a threshold describing a minimum
    level of market availability. All private-label or house branded
    products are automatically excluded from consideration
V.  Of the 1,500 brands that met the minimum sales thresholds, 164 met
    the market availability threshold defined as having at least \$1K
    and 100 units in sales per day (on average) over a 90-day window,
    across 6 or more distinct retail organizations

## Extending This Work

A proposed third metric that can be useful for ranking brands is defined
in retail terms as Brand-Share. Similar to Market-Share, Brand-Share is
a retail term that is defined as:

> Brand share is defined as **the percentage of a given product
> category's sales that is attributed to one brand**[^2]
