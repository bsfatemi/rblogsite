Using Highway Cannabis as our retailer case study, and specifically,
using sales data from their Marina Del Rey location, I will analyze
their rewards data and identify a correlation between brands that have
rewarded their budtenders, and trends in their consumer sales
transactions for those brands.

# Impact of Rewards on Brand Sales

In total, at Highway Cannabis (Marina Del Rey) there are nine brands
that offered rewards during the later half of 2022; however, of those 9
brands, there were four that offered a signficant number of rewards
concentrated in the months of August, September, and October of 2022.
This is shown in the chart below.

Furthermore, the four brands identified in the chart above have products
that fall into three categories (edibles, vapes, and flower). For the
next step in this analysis, I will analyze the sales data for two groups
(four brands offering rewards vs all other brands that offered no
rewards), across two time periods (the period in which rewards were
redeemed, and a period of the same length immediately prior where no
rewards were offered by any brand), and three product category segments.

## Objective

The objective is very simple, I'd like to understand whether there is a
meaningful difference in total sales for brands that were offering
rewards during a defined time period, and all other brands during the
same period, as well as a comparison of both across a prior time period
where no rewards were offered.

## Methodology

First, I split sales transactions into the following time periods:

1.  Earning Rewards time period of 60 days (8/22/2022 - 10/22/2022).
    This corresponds with the rewards data shown in the graph above
    where a large number of rewards were being earned and redeemed by
    budtenders for the four brands in focus.

2.  Pre-Rewards time period of 60 days (6/21/2022 - 8/21/2022). This
    corresponds to a period where 0 rewards were offered and redeemed by
    budtenders and spans the same number of days as the Earning Rewards
    period that immediately follows.

Next, I group sales data and analyze sales for products that fall into
the following categories: Edibles, Vapes, and Flower products.

Lastly, I analyze the relevant data for each of the four brands as well
as a larger group of all other brands that I'll categorize as one big
control group (brands that offered no rewards across either time
period).

## Results

In summary, when comparing brands that **offered rewards** vs. brands
that **offered no rewards**, across two consequtive 60 day periods
(no-rewards vs earning rewards time periods), I found the following:

> *Brands offering rewards saw an **average increase in total sales of
> 67%** in the period in which rewards were being redeemed by budtenders
> (Figure 1), while brands that offered no rewards **saw an average
> percentage decline of 8.5%** in total sales (Figure 3) across the same
> time periods. Furthermore, we see that brands offering rewards also
> benefited in sharp increases in the percentage of total sales across
> both of these time periods (Figure 2).*

As a reminder, these are the definitions for the time periods being
shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3:

Earning Rewards Period

:   The period in which rewards were offered and continued to be
    redeemed (8/22/2022 - 10/22/2022)

Pre-Rewards Period

:   The period immediately before rewards began being redeemed by
    budtenders (6/21/2022 - 8/21/2022
