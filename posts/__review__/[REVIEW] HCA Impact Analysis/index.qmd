Retailer Medithrive's increasing utilization of the Happy platform is
shown to be correlated with the positive outcomes and growth seen in
various KPIs that describe business performance. Not only has their
**monthly order-velocity increased (+19%) since adoption of the Happy
ecosystem**, their average **sales per order has increased (+28%) over
the same time period**. Additionally, Medithrive is experiencing a
surging boom in the number of unique products and brands they offer on
their menu. These results and more are shown in the [Summary of Results]
section of this post.

## Background

Medithrive is one of HCA's earliest retail clients, having signed up for
HCA access in April of 2020. Currently, we have access to Medithrive's
transactional data starting from March of 2019 and spanning to present
day. This case study explores the following metrics calculated for the
period prior to Medithrive becoming an HCA retailer (March 2019 - March
2020), as well as the period after Medithrive signed up for platform
access (April 2020 - Present), and a difference of means test was
conducted to ensure statistical significance of the results.

The KPI analyzed are as follows:

-   `Total Orders by Month`

-   `Total Sales by Month`

-   `Average Sales Per Order by Month`

-   `The Number of Unique Brands Sold by Month`

-   `The Number of Unique Products Sold by Month`

-   `The Share of all Units Sold via Retail (vs Delivery)`

### Why Medithrive

Medithrive has a dataset that spans many years and includes a full year
of transactions that occurred prior to becoming an HCA client. This is
ideal as it gives us a large enough sample size to be statistically
confident in the differences in KPI values across periods (pre-HCA vs
post-HCA). Additionally, Medithrive is an ideal client for this case
study as they have heavily invested in the adoption and usage of Happy
Marketers, our tool that has the most directly measurable impact on
top-line revenue growth and sales-velocity.

The plot below validates their increasing utilization of HCA tools, and
demonstrates the growth in the total number of Marketing Campaigns
executed by Medithrive via Happy Marketers over a two-year period:

The upward trend in utilization of Happy Marketers is correlated with
the trends in the KPIs analyzed for Medithrive over the same period.
This is consistent with our expectation and core belief:

> Using Happy Marketers, as well as other analytical products offered in
> the Happy ecosystem, leads directly to positive business impact.
> Specifically, this case study demonstrates and validates HCA's
> founding mission: to optimize cannabis product inventory and maximize
> product sell-through for our retail clients.
