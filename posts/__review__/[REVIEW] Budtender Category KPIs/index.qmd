This analysis shows that for a given category, in this case I am
evaluating `Flower product` performance, and using the performance
metric `Sales ($) Per Hour`, we can identify budtenders that generate
the least dollars in flower sales, and estimate the overall sales
(top-level revenue) impact of targeting Flower training courses towards
these lower performing budtenders.

More specifically, I demonstrate that:

> *After identifying budtenders that require additional training for
> Flower products, and then targeting Zoltrain courses towards those
> budtenders, we can expect top-line sales to increase by 13%. This
> comes from an increase in flower sales of 30% driven by Zoltrain.
> Ultimately, the targeted training will translate to Aurora having an
> estimated \$2,100 more in total sales revenue per day.*

## Ex: Performance of Given Budtender

First let's evaluate `Sales Per Hour` for a randomly chosen budtender
`Darrell F` at Verano store `Aurora`. With the plot below, I can show
(and ultimately compare) Darrell's performance in this KPI, across all
categories, and against all other budtenders at Aurora.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following takeaways can be extracted from this plot:

-   [***Darrell underperforms when selling***]{.underline} *Vapes and
    Flowers. This means Darrell sells less units or cheaper units of
    Vapes and Flowers than other budtenders at Aurora per hour*

-   [***Darrell falls within the average range***]{.underline} *of
    budtenders at Aurora for Edibles, Prerolls, Tablets/Capsules, and
    Tinctures*

-   [***Darrell overperforms when selling***]{.underline} *Extract
    products compared with other budtenders at Aurora*

-   [***Darrell has not sold any products***]{.underline} *in the Drinks
    or Tinctures categories. This is considered the most under
    performing in these groups as Darrell is likely not empowered to
    sell these items*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ex: Performance of All Budtenders for Flower

Next, let's take a look at the average sales per hour for Flower
products (vs all other products) for every budtender at Aurora. In the
plot below, we can see that there are 8 budtenders that fall in the
highest performance group, and similarly 8 that fall in the lowest
performance group.

# Expected Impact of Zoltrain Training

Next, I want to explore the question:

> What happens if we target the 8 low performing budtenders with
> Zoltrain courses and training materials specifically for Flower
> products and brands?

#### First, let's start with a few basic facts:

1.  Top-performers sell an average of \$225 per hour of flower products,
    while mid-performers sell \$193, and low performers sell \$109 per
    hour

2.  Zoltrain course impact has been shown to have a [67% positive
    impact](https://happycabbage.app/blog/posts/Zoltrain%20Course%20Completions/zotrain_rewards_impact.html)
    on sales for products where budtenders complete training courses
    towards

3.  The majority of the gains of budtender training come from up-sells
    and recommendations that increase total ticket size, thus
    outweighing any product cannibalization effects

4.  If we target 8 low performing budtenders for flower product
    training, we expect their average of \$109 flower sales per hour to
    increase

#### Next, let's make the following assumption:

> Since Zoltrain impact analysis shows us an [average impact of 67% from
> training](https://happycabbage.app/blog/posts/Zoltrain%20Course%20Completions/zotrain_rewards_impact.html),
> using an assumption that the average sales of flower products for this
> group will increase 30% from targeted training is a very conservative
> approach

#### Finally, let's estimate the sales per day impact:

Using the starting facts and the assumption above, I can calculate that
if low performing budtenders sold 30% more flower dollars, and based on
the proportion of other products that budtenders sell as well, this
would result in an increase of 13% in top-line sales dollars. This is
summarized here:

**This expected 13% revenue boost from budtender training that comes
from increases in flower sales dollars of 30% (bringing the low
performing budtender average of \$109 to \$142 per hour), ultimately
translates to Aurora having \$2,100 more revenue per day**

This section includes additional analysis that came from this effort,
and provides more contextual information about budtenders at Aurora.

### Overall (Total) Velocity

Specifically the plot below describes overall Velocity defined as Units
Sold Per Day for every budtender at Aurora, as well as the budtender's
category mix that composes their total units sold per day.

### Average (Total) Velocity by Group

Here is a summary of the average total units sold per day for each
Performance Group shown in the plot above:
