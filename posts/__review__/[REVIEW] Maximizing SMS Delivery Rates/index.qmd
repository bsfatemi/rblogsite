This post assesses whether campaign Deliverability Rate can be predicted
by first identifying campaign statistics that have a strong correlation
with higher or lower deliverability. The insights derived from this
analysis translate initially to 5 best practices that can improve the
deliverability over time. Additionally, included below are details for
each and interactive charts that describe every orgs performance on
these 5 best practices.

# Executive Summary

This work illustrates the potential for successfully predicting the
deliverability rate of a given campaign, but more concretely, I
highlight five important factors that have a significantly strong
correlation with the deliverability rate. [These translate to a set of 5
best practices that will increase your average deliverability rate over
time]{.underline}:

> Campaign size is strongly correlated with deliverability; **don't go
> above 3K total targets** and preferably shoot for between 500 and
> 1000. See [Campaign Total Targets]
>
> Campaigns that include an image have a much higher deliverability on
> average, thus **always include images with each campaign** (see
> [Definitely Include an Image])
>
> Campaigns that have an Emoji in the message body perform better, thus
> **use emojis when crafting your message** (see [Use Emojis in the
> Message])
>
> Campaigns that mention actual prices in the message perform worse on
> average, thus, **don't mention prices, instead describe a discount**
> (see [Don't Mention Product Prices](#dont-mention-product-prices))
>
> Campaigns that use the word "free" in the message perform worse, thus,
> **avoid use the word "free" altogether** (see [Don't Use the Word
> "Free"](#dont-use-the-word-free))

# Methodology

For every org with at least 50 campaigns, I calculated a range of
campaign statistics in order to test whether there was correlation with
the average deliverability rate and these metrics. Out of all the
campaign metrics tested, I identified 5 traits associated with a
campaign that can impact the overall deliverability significantly:

-   How large the campaign is (Total Targets)

-   Whether or not the campaign includes an Image

-   Whether or not the campaign body describes product prices

-   Whether or not the campaign message has the word "Free"

-   Whether or not an Emoji is used in the campaign message

Next, I summarized every org to show the average value of the 5 metrics
above. Here is a subset of the data showing the first few row:

|                | Ave Target Count | Ave Deliverability | Has Image | Mentions Price | Mentions Free | Includes Emoji |
|:----------|----------:|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| mankind        |             4028 | 65.6%              | 91.1%     | 17.6%          | 5.7%          | 17.7%          |
| spark          |              861 | 76.6%              | 4.9%      | 42.3%          | 19.0%         | 0.0%           |
| beelinebuzz    |              835 | 84.1%              | 48.4%     | 34.4%          | 6.2%          | 21.9%          |
| lucid          |              982 | 69.3%              | 45.8%     | 55.1%          | 0.4%          | 1.3%           |
| sava           |             1482 | 82.7%              | 16.4%     | 28.9%          | 2.5%          | 4.2%           |
| iheartcannabis |              138 | 96.3%              | 13.8%     | 4.3%           | 0.7%          | 1.4%           |

Then I ran a series of linear regressions to attempt to predict
deliverability rate and found that these 5 stats can predict 50% of the
variability in average deliverability rates:

# Results

Here are the high-level takeaways regarding the 5 important factors that
can impact deliverability

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Campaign Total Targets

The higher the total targets the more likely the deliverability rate
will be lower. Note for the chart below:

-   Campaigns w/**3K or more targets** have average **deliverability**
    **between 65% and 75%**
-   Campaigns w/**1.5K or less targets** have average **deliverability
    above 80%**
-   Campaigns w/around **500 targets** have a an average
    **deliverability rate around 90%**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
readRDS("widgets/sms_target_size.rds")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Definitely Include an Image

On average campaigns that include an image perform dramatically better.
Note from the chart below:

-   Orgs that **rarely or never** include an image, have average
    deliverability rates **ranging from 67% to 77%**

-   Orgs that **almost always** include an image have a higher
    likelihood of reaching **deliverability above 85%**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
readRDS("widgets/sms_include_image.rds")

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Use Emojis in the Message

Interestingly, campaigns that include emojis on average **perform
10%-15% better** than campaigns that use only plain text

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
readRDS("widgets/sms_include_emoji.rds")

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Don't Mention Product Prices {#dont-mention-product-prices}

Campaigns that mention prices in the message body are more likely to see
slightly lower deliverability rates. Instead of mentioning a price,
mention percentage discounts (which don't show a negative impact on
deliverability). For example, instead of "\$9.99 for a limited time"
switch to "30% off for a limited time"

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
readRDS("widgets/sms_include_price.rds")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Don't Use the Word "Free" {#dont-use-the-word-free}

There is a correlation with campaigns that use the term "free" in the
body, and campaigns that have a lower deliverability rate. This could be
a signal used by sms providers to flag messages. Instead of saying "Buy
1 get 1 Free", say "Buy 1 and get one on us". Note from the chart below:

-   Orgs that **include the word "Free"** in at least 30% of their
    campaigns are averaging around **70-80% deliverability**

-   While those that **rarely or never use that term** are seeing around
    **85-95% deliverability** on average

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
readRDS("widgets/sms_mention_free.rds")
```
