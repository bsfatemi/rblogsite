## Objective

This post aims to arrive at a defensible prediction for a cannabis
customer's LTV, as well as estimate of the length of their lifetime, and
finally, to use these insights to better understand the purchase
behavior of retained customers in the cannabis market.

## Summary of Results

In this analysis, I demonstrate that the average length of a customer's
lifetime is about 10 quarters or nearly 3 years, additionally, **a
retained customer will have about 55 orders and spend roughly \$7K over
this period**.

Using the insights here, we can begin to understand how important
retention is in cannabis through the purchase behavior of retained
customers:

-   Retained customers return on average **every 3 weeks**

-   Retained customers spend on average **\$130 per order**

-   Retained customers generate on average **\$7K in sales**

-   Retained customers are loyal for an average period of **3 years**

## Methodology

In this analysis, I explore customer cohorts for a sampled set of orgs
on a quarterly basis for a 5-year period. Using their sales data, I
first model a rate of drop off of those customers. Next I analyze sales
attrition as well as orders attrition from the decreasing pool of
customers each quarter. Lastly, I derive an estimate for LTV and use
that to better understand the purchase behavior of retained customers in
the cannabis market.

## Analysis

I first estimated the length of a customers average life-time by
analyzing cohorts of customers for a set of sampled orgs. For example,
using one org in my sample, I identified 212 customers with transactions
in Q2 of 2018, and tracked these particular customers, their orders, and
their sales, across quarters until Q2 2023. In the last quarter only 34
of these customers remain with purchases in each period. This attrition
curve reaches 50% by roughly the 10th quarter (e.g. 50% of the customers
remain after 10 quarters).

This plot demonstrates the average lifetime of a cannabis consumer:

Once we arrived at a lifetime estimate of 10 quarters, I analyzed the
average sales, and the average orders per quarter for these customers.

The figures below track both sales and orders coming from the customers
identified across time:
