    "text": "Exploring The Data\nThe data I utilized for this analysis are daily inventory snapshots beginning on 4/12/22 and ending on 9/24/23. The data for this time period includes roughly 385K unique products across 118 retail locations.\nHere are a few key insights on the retailers I studied:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average, Retailers…\n\nCarry 730 products in inventory on any given day, and 2,300 unique products over the course of a year\nHave 500K units across all products in inventory on a given day\nThe average cost of inventory held by the retailer on a given day is roughly $120K, equating to an average of roughly $500 in costs per product in stock\nCarry products that are available to sell for 72 days of the year, while being out of stock for roughly 20% of the time between its’ first sale and last sale (see figure below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn short, products that have reoccurring supply (resupplied more than once) during this period, tend to go out of stock every 5 days (e.g. 20% of the days within its’ sales period), causing a sales disruption. This can be seen in the figure above which shows the average sales period for products by org, and identifies the proportion of days in and out of stock during the sales period."

    "text": "Supply Chain Volatility\nIn cannabis, we see evidence that consumer demand is much more predictable than supply. In fact, in response to this supply chain volatility, retailers are often overstocking products due to the uncertainty around future availability from suppliers. This results in growing inventory costs over time, as the natural tendency in a highly competitive industry is to ensure products are always available to meet demand. In an environment where products are highly interchangeable, such as in the cannabis space, inventory can and should be optimized to address supply chain issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does “optimized inventory” look like…\n\n\n\nOptimized inventory ensures that a retailer can meet changing demand without incurring additional and unnecessary inventory costs. In practical terms, over a long period of time (in the case of this analysis 75 weeks), it is reasonable to expect that inventory costs should be correlated with sales trends over the same period.\n\n\nFor this group of retailers studied here that show increasing inventory levels, we can see in the figure below that their trend in inventory is not correlated with growth in sales."

    "section": "Results of Analysis",
    "text": "Results of Analysis\nOf the 118 retailers whose inventory I studied over the course of 75 weeks, 82% of these stores experience highly volatile and/or growing inventory at a rate that far exceeds any growth in sales. This is very consistent with the notion that supply chain volatility leads to highly volatile retail inventory levels (both as measured by the costs to carry stock, as well as the total units on hand for any given week) and is additional evidence that overstocking is an issue affecting retailers industry-wide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly half of the retailers that comprise the 82% are experiencing highly accelerated growth in both total units on hand in a given week as well as total inventory costs carried per week. While the remaining experience unsustainable swings in total units available week to week.\n\n\n\n\nGrowth in Weekly Stock\nThe chart below shows the average weekly percent change in total inventory units on hand (all products) for 39 retail locations. Additionally, we can see the 85% confidence interval in red around each week in the period, as well as the week to week group average shown with the black line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese 39 retail locations show a 250% year over year growth of total units carried in inventory, relative to the amount of stock carried in week one\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote, weekly stock is defined as the total units carried (across all rooms for a retailer). Additionally, in the charts shown, weekly stock level is expressed as a percentage relative to the amount of stock carried in week one. This lets us normalize retailers of varying sizes in order to draw a fair comparison when analyzing how inventory changes overtime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolatility in Weekly Stock\nThe chart below shows the average weekly % change in total inventory units on hand (all products) for 54 retail locations. Similar to the plot above, the blue demonstrates the 85% confidence interval around the average per week, while the black line represents the average over time for the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor these 54 retail locations, we see roughly no change in units on hand between the first week and last week in the period, however during the course of the year, inventory levels swing as low as 50% and as high as 200% relative to the amount of stock carried in week one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeclining Weekly Stock (Total Units Carried)\nThe remaining 18% of retailers are adequately reducing inventory costs while maintaining or growing sales over the same period."

Similarly, the impact after 45 days with no stockouts for this product is increased revenues of $4,607 (shown in Figure 2).\nThe modeling approach used here suggests that any actions taken to reduce the likelihood of product stockouts for important revenue-driving products would yield immediate benefit in the form of increased sales for these products on a daily basis (Figure 1)"

This situation arises when demand is higher than expected and the amount of normal inventory and safety stock is too low to fill all orders.3\n\nPrimary Product\n\nI define a primary product as a product that when purchased, drives the majority of the total order dollars. On average, if a product drives over 50% of the total ticket sales, this product would be classified as a primary product. In contrast, a secondary product typically is thought of as an ‘order add-on’ and drives a smaller share of the customers’ total spend per order."

    "text": "Results\nFigure 1 shows the actual cumulative sales for this primary product over the course of a 90-day sales period as well as the expected (or predicted) cumulative sales in a world in which there are no stockouts occurring during the period. The difference between the lines on the chart (the area denoted in green) is the sales impact of stockouts at particular points in time.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sales But For Stockouts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Plot\n\n\n\nSince we are using 90 days for our sales period, the 50% mark on the x-axis corresponds to 45 days. At 45 days, the difference between the actual sales (with stockouts) and the expected sales (without stockouts) is the total sales generated through 45 days but-for stockouts. See Figures 2 and 3 for additional clarity.\n\n\n\nSales But For Stockouts\nThe annotated plots below provides additional guidance for reading and understanding the results. At any given time during the period, to see the sales impact from stockouts through that moment in time, look at the difference between the prediction and the actual sales.\n\nTo illustrate this, we can see that when we are 50% of the way through the period (i.e. day 45 of a 90 day period), the difference at that moment in the estimate and the actual sales is highlighted in the plot below.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Impact after 45 days\n\n\n\nSimilarly, we can see the same insight at day 90 (x = 100%) below. The difference between estimated revenue and actual revenue after 90 days of product sales is called out below.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Impact after 90 days\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Study Caveats\n\n\n\n\nThe product identified for this case study is a regular menu item, one that is a primary product, and has no recent upward or downward trends in sales for the 90 day study period.\nBy selecting a primary product with neutral sales trend (flat, no increase or decline in sales over time)4, but specifically one that has stable daily unit sales (uniformly distributed throughout the period), we can best illustrate the methodology we use to estimate the dollar impact of stockouts in the period.\nIn this case study, stockouts are implicitly identified using days with no unit sales as the proxy for a stockout occurring. This is justifiable as we specifically use a product with regular daily unit sales throughout the period.\nIn generalizing this methodology or extending this work, we would utilize historical daily inventory snapshots to explicitly identify whether there is a product stockout for a particular sales day.\nIt’s important to highlight the fact that the expected gains in revenue are at the product sales level. In practice, when a product experiences stockouts, oftentimes retailers have available substitutes to limit any negative impacts to the Retailers top-line revenues. However, for a select group of products with high customer loyalty, not all the sales can be recovered and best efforts need to be made in order to mitigate stockout events."

    "text": "Note about the Model:\nDemand is expressed as a function \\(Demand = F(P)\\); where \\(F(P)\\) (being a function of Price) is estimated with the following equation using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM): \\(F(P) = B_2(ln(P) * ln(P + 1)) + B_1\\). This Model gives us the expected shape of a price/demand relationship and the data supports such a fit as can be seen in the results section below.\n\nFor this model, the term \\(B_2\\) can be considered the price elasticity of demand depending on the product type (Chocolate Bar, Camino Gummy, or Terra Bites) and \\(B_1\\) is considered the minimum level of demand for such a product. The accuracy metrics for this model are the model \\(R^2\\), the model \\(p-value\\) as well as the model \\(F-statistic\\). The accuracy for this model ranges from 80% (Kiva Terra Bites) to 90% (Kiva Chocolate Bars) while the confidence interval around the model’s fit is 95%."

    "text": "Influencing the Curve\n\nSurgeons who perform procedures more often outperform surgeons that complete the same number of procedures less often (more days between cases)\n\nAnalysis of the learning curve model for various cohorts of Surgeons can help identify specific drivers of increased performance. For example, the following exploratory visualization (figure 1) provides support to the hypothesis that Surgeons who perform procedures more often outperform surgeons that complete the same number of procedures less often (more days between cases). The performance indicator in this case is overall procedure duration. In figure 1 below, the frequency difference between groups is identified empirically using the top and bottom 25th percentile in the total number of days between cases.1 This observation is seen across all 6 procedure types indicated in the plot below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - Comparison of Surgeon Groups\n\n\nFigure 1 above shows the difference in Average Procedure Duration across groups of surgeons that were classified as performing 100 total procedures more frequently (the top 70th percentile in time taken to perform 100 total cases) vs less frequently (bottom 30th percentile). By controlling for total cases performed across groups, we can capture the true impact that frequency has on the learning curve outcome measure used (procedure duration)."

    "text": "Actionable Learning Indicators (Levers of Learning)\nThe following variables have been studied and demonstrated to have a significant impact on the learning curve. These are referred to as Levers of Learning. \n\nCase Mix: captures effects attributed to general complexity, degree of specialization, and transferred background learning. Case Mix best accounts for procedure agnostic learning that can be transferred across a series of different cases that a given surgeon performs\nCase Frequency:captures the effect on expected efficiency that is largely attributed to the time between subsequent cases. Empirical observations of robotic surgery data suggest that a large portion of the gain in efficiency that comes from Surgeon learning is the degree of exposure a surgeon has within a fixed period of time\nProcedure Velocity: is a derivation of Case Frequency; however, the interpretation of Velocity is not based on exposure within a fixed period of time. Rather, Velocity is expressed as a point-in-time measure of the degree of case exposure, for all historical cases through most recent observation.2\n\n\nBenchmarking with Baseline Learning Curve\n\nThe result demonstrates that if surgeons perform cases more frequently as they continue gaining experience, then they actually shift to a more desirable learning curve.\n\nThe following illustrates a baseline learning curve modeled using Robotic Surgery data across a number of procedure types. Furthermore, we can adjust model parameters to understand its impact on the learning trajectory. The top most learning curve in figure 2 is the baseline expected trajectory of procedure duration through a surgeons first 100 cases. From there, we show new learning curves assuming greater and greater case frequency scenarios. The result demonstrates that if surgeons perform cases more frequently as they continue gaining experience, then they actually shift to a more desirable learning curve.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Shifting the Learning Curve"
